# Simple Notebook

A simple notebook. This is my Angular2 pet project.

To try you have to:

1. install server side requirements
```
pip install -r server/requirements.txt
```

2. start a python server side app:
```
python server/app.py
```

3. Install packages from packages.json
```
npm install
```

4. start the lite-server with npm on repo root directory.
```
npm start
```
